# taskDock

TaskDock is a small demo app that visualizes agent coordination patterns (sequential, parallel, and handoff) in a React UI.

## What’s in this repo

- `frontend/` — Vite + React + TypeScript UI

## Run the app locally

From the repo root:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build and lint

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Notes

- The UI uses Tailwind CSS utilities. The Tailwind Vite plugin is already configured in `frontend/vite.config.ts`.
